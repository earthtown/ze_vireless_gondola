# ze_vireless_gondola

the late beginnings of an overdue upgrade to the wonderful gocupi project

Using arduino ide 1.6.7 with esp8266 add-on (? not sure wtf it's technically called) 
You can find install steps for at: https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino

Don't forget to put the library dirs in the proper location.

the code included in the form of an arduino sketch is by no means anything that you should use for proper applications, it is but a proof of concept to confirm working hardware.
